# Excessive scrolling works because of emotional avoidance. (and how to stop it)

What's interesting and dangerous about a "feed" is that it is a powerful avoidance mechanism that keeps people in avoidance.

For example, you notice a painful emotion in your body, so you do what you always have done: reflexively reach for your phone and begin scrolling.

When you scroll, attention is removed from your body and invested in the feed or whatever content you consume.

This offers "relief" from the emotional pain in your body, yet it doesn't do anything about it; it just postpones the emotional integration.

So, the emotion is still there. But when you start scrolling, you'll encounter different micro-triggers on the feed, which create more small reactions you want to avoid feeling, so you scroll even more.

Which leads me to the conclusion that:

Avoidance is the engine that powers excessive scrolling behaviour. And the business models of the largest social companies.

The solution?

Stop avoiding your emotions. Before scrolling, ask yourself, "What emotion am I avoiding right now?" and take a few breaths to welcome it. Often, you'll notice the desire and need to scroll go away. 

Scroll because you want to, not because you need to.


# Relax all day (and still get stuff done)

What if it was easy to operate life from a state of relaxed ease?

I believe tension from stress doesn't get tasks done more easily.  It's a bad deal because stress and tension:

a) Makes you miserable
b) Fatigues you quickly
c) Constrains your attention

Relaxation works better because you can access more internal resources to solve problems and move forward. It doesn't tire you out. And it's far more enjoyable.

How do you encourage relaxation?

1. Regular, cyclic, deep breathing (no pauses between inhales <> exhales <> inhales)

2. Muscle relaxation (use your awareness to relax muscles, imagine them melting)

3. Taking walking breaks that are nourishing

4. Not sitting for longer than 15 minutes

5. Writing out the resolution to problems and tasks so that the brain doesn't need to work on it

6. Doing a short yoga nidra every 3-5 hours

7. Going into Hakalau (utilizing your peripheral vision)

What if it was possible to be relaxed most of the day? The prevailing belief is that going into a stress-like state is better for getting things done than a relaxed state. It's very black and white. Relaxed means you don't get anything done. Stressed is when you do. But this doesn't seem right. Why would we be subjected to this duality? The truth is that we aren't.

Here are some beliefs powering reliance on stress:

1. Nothing will get done if I am not stressed

2. Stress is the path to success

3. Relaxation isn't effective

4. Relaxation means I can't focus

5. I can't have both

If you go through each and contemplate whether they are true, you may be surprised to see that many of them are BS.

You can relax and do things. It supercharges your performance. Don't believe me? Try it out.

# Own your wants

Be very honest and clear about what you want. 

This builds trust. 

If other people don't know what you want, they will make assumptions about what you want. There can be no miscommunication if you are clear about what you want. And often, as a result, people will open up to you about their wants.

The same is true for the parts within you. They have wants. Often conflicting.

So make sure to tell those parts what you honestly want for them. 

Tell them that you honestly want them to be loved. 
Tell them you want them to be healed. 
Tell them, from your very core, what you want for them.

In return, like with people, those parts will notice that you're being open and honest with them about your wants and may feel comfortable enough to tell you theirs. 

Mutual exchange of wants is leadership in action. It's healing. Wholeness.

# Stop writing about your problems

Journalling advice is dangerous.

Be careful of people who tell you to write about your problems. It's usually well-intentioned, but there is a hidden result that often bites you in the ass if you follow it.

By writing about your problems, you're solidifying them, reinforcing them in your brain. And you rarely find any solutions.

What usually happens is that you start writing in circles, finding more and more details about the problem that you didn't notice before; it may feel "productive" or "helpful," but it doesn't do anything.

It just keeps your problems going. Writing about your problems gives you more of the same problems.

It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. By writing about them and feeling the negative emotions associated with them, you are just telling your brain that this "problem" is important. There is not a lot of processing happening at all. No healing whatsoever. Which means there is no resolution.

Instead, write about what you want.

If you have a problem and want to resolve it, don't waste your time writing about it; instead, write about its resolution.

This will tell your brain that resolving the problem is important and will bring you closer to a resolution.

Some tips for doing this:

Avoid negative language (stuff like "I can't do this", or "It's way too hard to do this")
Use positive language instead ("I want to feel relief from this situation," "I can't wait to figure this out."
Have compassion for yourself (everyone has problems; beating yourself up just creates tension in your body)
Write until you feel a release (keep writing until you feel your emotions shift)

# What does this want to integrate into?

The next time you feel a really strong feeling, I want you to ask yourself this question:

What does this feeling want to integrate into?

It might feel odd to ask your feelings a question, but when you do, you'll receive a "signal," a subconscious thought, image, or feeling, with an answer.

So, if you ask your "anger" what it wants, notice what comes back. In most cases, it is trying to point you towards some action you need to take in your life.

It's even odder to think that your feelings have wants. But they do! They want:

1. To be noticed

2. Help integrating so that they can help you

3. To be loved

The strong, painful feeling is a "scary mask" designed to get your attention.

And once it does and is honestly, sincerely, and impartially seen by you, with as much detail as possible, it will transform into something completely new.

Your "anger" turns into "action".
Your "grief" into "gratitude".
Your "shame" into "love".

So, again, the next time you notice an intense feeling arise, don't fight it, don't be scared of it, don't run from it, pay attention to it, ask the question, and give the feeling what it wants.

# What now? (The only spiritual practice you need)

All spiritual practice leads you to this basic routine:

1) Ask the body, "What now?"

2) Recieve an answer

3) Act on that answer

The mind is there to help us work with the body. It's not the source of knowing. It's the facilitator. 

It's the tour guide to the greatest wonder in the world: your body.

Your body processes reality. It stores every good, bad, nasty, joyful thing you have ever experienced. 

And it knows what to do right now.

It knows what you must do to live the life you're meant to live. The problem is that we seldom listen to it. But it's always ready to work with us once we're ready to listen.

So ask it. Listen. 

Then, do what it offers you. 

Try it as an experiment. See how your mind protests. But follow through. Always follow through.

Consider the body's directives like divine commandments given to you as blessings to guide you through this life.

Treat them as holy. Because they are. And so are you.

# All statements are equally true (How to control your mind)

"All statements are equally true" - Jim Leonard

How? Context.

When looking at the sun with green-tinted sunglasses, the statement: "The sun is green" is very true.

In that context, the sun is green. But it's also true that the sun is blue, red, pink, and all the other colours. What matters is the context, or what sunglasses you have on.

Our minds work like sunglasses, but it's not one pair. Imagine a "pocket dimension" that stores sunglasses. An infinite hallway storing all types of sunglasses.

When you put on a pair of glasses, you adopt certain assumptions about the world that come with them.

Some of these glasses are helpful, but many are not.

And they determine our lives.

But the awesome thing about being human is that we can choose which sunglasses to wear.

How?

1. Words are magic. Use words to create a statement that represents the new context you want to live in 

ex: "It's okay for me to do things without others permission."

2. Mentally repeat that statement to yourself, then listen for parts of you that object to it. Note down their fears.

ex: "No! It's not okay, it's too hard, you need other people's help"

3. For each fear, construct a new statement that addresses that part's fears 

ex: "It's completely safe for me to do things with others permission"

4. Then prove to the objecting part how this new statement is true -- feel the part, accept it, or reject it.

ex: "Remember when we closed that deal without anyone telling us to? Doesn't that support this new context?"

5. If you feel resonance with the statement, move on to the next objection

ex: "It's okay for me to do things without others permission"

6. Repeat 2-5 until the original statement becomes true for your system.

This works because all statements are true. You can find contexts for them.

You are always happy.

You are always sad.

Both are true in different contexts.

Here is how this change process works:

Your mind is a 'pocket dimension' that already holds contexts. When you introduce a new context, the entire system of contexts changes.

Conflicts in assumptions and beliefs arise. But, by addressing each one, you can install new software. 

All statements are true, you have complete control over your mind.

All that it wants and needs is proof.

# R.A.I.N (Recognize, Accept, Investigate, Nurture)

Doing inner work is hard.

Especially with parts of us burdened with intense, negative emotions.

I learned about a framework for working with these parts. It's called RAIN. (Shoutout @know for sharing this with me)

R: Recognize

A: Accept without an agenda

I: Compassionately investigate

N: Nurture

Whenever a part arises:

We recognize what type of part it is

We accept it

We become curious about it

And then we do whatever we need to do to nurture this part back into health


The other day I ordered a small pizza for lunch.

Afterwards, I went for a walk and felt a craving to eat the leftovers.

I stopped, recognized that this was a part, allowed it to exist, and started to investigate.

I asked it where it was coming from and it told me that wasting food wasn't good.

I asked that part where it learned that, and the part zips me over to a younger version of myself.

Shamed by my parents for not finishing my lentil soup.

I look at that young boy, crying on the dining table, and I bring myself into that image with him.

I pull up a chair, put my hand on his head, and tell him that it will be alright and that he isn't alone.

I eat with him, and we finish. I tell him that I am there for him and that he doesn't need to worry again.

I tell him that if food goes to waste in the future, I will deal with it. He doesn't need to.

A shift occurs.

That craving turns into an intention to go home and throw the pizza out. And that is exactly what happens.

I throw it out.

Feeling no desire to eat it, when a few moments ago, it was all I wanted.

# Love all the parts

Love all the parts. Even the painful ones. Especially the painful ones. 

The tired ones. The scared ones. The worried ones. The hurt ones. The angry ones. The shameful ones. The guilty ones. The sad ones. The disappointed ones. The ones that think they aren't good enough. The ones that don't want to get into trouble anymore.

The ones who just want a break.

Love all your parts.

# Relaxation is the ultimate sadhana

The practice: relax as much tension in your body as you can.

By relaxing, you automatically enter the present moment. 

As you move your attention around your body, finding areas to release tension, you build more presence. 

Which allows your body, your fascia, to resonate, like a tuning fork, with the present moment.

All you have to do is relax and resonate.

# How to build great product experiences with AI

principle 1: user experiences are probabilistic, not deterministic

you can’t control how someone experiences your product. experiences are personal and subjective. all you can do is increase the likelihood that they’ll have a positive one. AI’s role is to optimize the odds—it doesn’t guarantee anything, but it can shape the environment to make a positive outcome more likely. it’s about shaping probabilities, not dictating experiences.

principle 2: AI is the gardener, not the architect

AI isn’t building rigid systems or telling users what to do. it’s creating a flexible, adaptive environment. think of it like a gardener, not an architect. the AI helps set the right conditions for users to succeed, but it doesn’t control how that success happens. over time, it adapts as users interact with it, growing and evolving alongside them.

principle 3: create a dynamic, learning environment

a great product is a living system. the product experience should constantly learn from its users, adjusting and improving based on how people interact with it. right now, we rely on human feedback to do this, but the future is a product that can learn directly from its users. it evolves, refines, and adapts in real-time, cutting out the middleman and making the feedback loop faster and more direct.

principle 4: co-regulate with the user’s nervous system

one of the most powerful things a product can do is sync with the user’s nervous system. your product should be able to regulate stress and calmness in the user. by paying attention to how users behave (like when they’re frustrated or taking too long on a task), the AI can adjust the experience to keep them either engaged or calm, depending on what’s needed. this creates a more personalized, responsive experience.

principle 5: start broad, refine subtle

when building a product, you start with big adjustments. you need to see what works and what doesn’t. but over time, as the AI learns more about the user, it should begin making smaller, more subtle refinements. these marginal gains are where the real magic happens, turning a decent product into a great one. it’s the little things that often make the biggest difference.

principle 6: reveal hidden constraints

users don’t always know what’s holding them back. sometimes they’re limited by things they can’t see—whether it’s mental, emotional, or something else. the AI’s job is to identify those hidden constraints and surface them in a way that helps the user move forward. by watching for patterns in behavior, AI can help users overcome obstacles they might not even realize they have.

principle 7: the product is always evolving

there’s no such thing as a finished product. users change, expectations shift, and the world moves forward. your product has to keep evolving. AI should be built to continuously learn and adapt, so the product stays relevant and valuable even as the world around it changes. it’s a constant cycle of evaluation and improvement.

principle 8: fail gracefully, iterate rapidly

not everything will work right away, and that’s fine. the key is to iterate quickly and learn from failures. even when things go wrong, your product should still provide value and recover gracefully. AI helps by speeding up the iteration process, making adjustments smarter each time. it’s about learning fast, failing fast, and improving faster.

# Spiritual Significance

Modern productivity often feels empty and pointless. 

An example of this is school. There are processes in my body-mind system. Parts of me that worry— "if I don't worry about schoolwork and assignments, they're not going to get done".

If that doesn’t happen, I'll get a bad grade. A bad grade means wasted money. It means my parents might yell at me, or worse, feel disappointed.

Shame. Avoiding shame drives so much of the emptiness. Part of me can't stand the shame.

But creating a sense of spiritual significance could help. That's the hypothesis at least.

Because it lets you see the shame and contextualize it— letting it move and process by itself.

It helps you understand why "mind" resists. Because a mind without context, is a mind that cannot make sense of why it exists.

It needs significance.

The knowledge in our brains works in this way. Knowledge needs connections. If there's a neuron that isn't connected to others, it gets pruned away.

To create significance, you need to increase its relationality. Take something that feels isolated, like schoolwork, and connect it to something greater:

How does this new thing fit into the story of your life so far?
What significance does this thing have in relation to your ancestors?
What devotional rituals can you start doing to make this task less mundane?
It becomes more than a task; it becomes a part of the tapestry of life.

The key is to keep exploring how to make these connections stronger. Adding more and more layers of significance.

To keep finding ways to make life spiritually significant.

# Coherent Relaxing (The ultimate way to regulate your autonomic nervous system)

This is the last nervous system regulation instruction you may ever need.

This process is predictable. Reliable. Repeatable.

You can experience a profound meditative state if you follow it for long enough.

Here's what to do:

1) Sit on the edge of your chair, feet firmly planted on the ground, spine straight 

2) Set a timer for 10 minutes and tell yourself that you will not move for the remainder of this session

3) Close your eyes

4) Inhale to the count of 6

5) Without pausing at the top of your inhalation, immediately start exhaling to a count of 6

6) Without pausing at the bottom of your exhalation, immediately start inhaling to a count of 6

7) Repeat this cycle

8) While inhaling and exhaling, relax the 6 bridges.

What are the 6 bridges?*
1. Your head and face

2. Your neck and tongue

3. Your hands

4. Your diaphragm and intercostals

5. Your pelvic floor

6. Your feet

Imagine that your body is a cup that can hold a golden fluid. 

As you inhale, that fluid starts from your feet and rises all the way up your body until it reaches the top of your head at the top of your inhale. 

As you exhale, imagine that fluid falling back down from your head back down to your feet.

When the fluid reaches one of the bridges, like your head and face, consciously relax that area.

This leads to better nervous system balance, incresed HRV, less stress, and a very deep meditative state.

* I first learned about the 6 bridges through Stephen Elliot, he is the originator of this phrase.

# The Hallway (How to access your subconscious)

I image myself going down the stairs, into the subconscious. 10 steps in all.

I open the door at the bottom. The first door in the hallway, on the left contains the inner child. I walk in. 

The “greeter” appears. He sits on a bed, wearing a yellow sweater with Goofy on it, rocking a bowl haircut. I connect with him and he tells me how happy he feels that I have worked with so many parts within myself. He shows me, in the next few rooms, all my parts. 

I leave this room. I go to the next room. The expanse. 

This room, when you walk in, sucks you into expansion. I feel my access to the ventral vagal nervous system. When I join with it, the greenness of it makes me feel safe.

I remember what Deb Dana shares about Ventral Vagal landscapes. Each landscape appears uniquely to the individual and comes with a sliding scale of depth. For me, just entering into Ventral Vagal brings gentleness and tingles. While going all the way into Ventral weighs like thousands of pounds of wet, nutrient-dense soil, feeding your soul.

I leave this room.


The next room. The Wizard.

I peer through — looking around his laboratory — I notice him hunched over a chemistry setup and tinkering with different vials. I ask: “Get me up to speed?”. He looks up and gives me a smirk. With a vial in one hand, he trots over: “I shall heal that nasty viral thing in us. (I have Covid atm) You see this green thing? Medicine. To take it, imagine feeling into unwell parts. Imagine a green awareness flowing through.”

I take the medicine. Following his instructions. I noticeably feel a bit better.

I go to the next room. The spirit animal. 

I see a dark, desolate forest. I look up and see a huge Owl. His eyes sparkle, made up of glimmers of gold and silver. I feel his calm. I feel a knowing emanating from him. He knows. He knows me. He sees me. I sit next to him. We both stare out into the forest. I feel that he wants to share something with me. A message. In a deep voice, I hear him in my mind as he grumbles “Open your eyes and see clearly. You miss the big picture.”

I leave this room.

I head back into the hallway. 

The next room contains Gifts from the Higher Self.

I walk in. Immediately I smell a calming, soothing aroma. I walk through an ancient Egyptian palace. I see silk robes flowing down from the massive pillars. I look ahead and see an alter. Next to the alter, a curved sword and a bowl. I know it wants an offering. I slit my hand and let blood flow into the bowl. The bowl glows and disappears. On the mantel, I see a small, brown notebook. Inside the book I read about all the adventures awaiting in this life. I feel that whatever has given me this wants me to know that my life grows richer everyday.

I put the book in my pocket and head out.

I walk back down the hallway.

I go outside and ascend the stairs, back into this moment.

Clarity. Healing. Hope.

# Forgiveness (How to purify your mind for good)

Repeat the statement “I forgive myself for not understanding” in your heart.

Repeat it over and over.



After some time, you will notice memories come up. Painful ones. Once they come up, you need to address them.



Let’s say you remember a time when you made a mistake. Mentally repeat: “I forgive myself for making that mistake.”

You may notice your mind complain at first. Mentally repeat: “I forgive my mind for not wanting to forgive.”

Then, go back and repeat the statement: “I forgive myself for making that mistake”.

Make sure to relax as it happens. Relax your head. Relax your face and jaw. Relax anything that is tensing because of the memory.

Experiment with it. Find words that work for you. Words that evoke a warm heart. Relax in a way that works for you. Play with it.

Now, let’s say that a new memory comes up after you’ve resolved the first that reminds you of someone who did something to you.

You repeat: “I forgive you for not understanding.” or “I forgive you for not understanding how you caused me pain.”

Genuinely. Sincerely. Wholeheartedly (to the extent you can) forgive.


You can do this anywhere. Anytime. And every time you do it, those memories will plague you less and less. Leaving you a pure and clean mind.

After doing this for a while, transition into mentally asking for forgiveness for others you've hurt. (Please forgive me for not understanding.)

# Gratitude

Gratitude can solve problems. It can bring new opportunities. It can heal past hurts. It can help you make decisions. It can help you with conflicts. 
I know it can feel confusing. People have a lot to say about Gratitude. I do too.

But maybe I can offer you a bit more clarity.

To get started with gratitude you need:

To become familiar with how it feels

To process any resistance you have towards it

To create a practice

1) How does Gratitude feel?
The word "Gratitude" will evoke a very specific sensation within your body. It will be unique to you.

You can learn it by closing your eyes and imagining a memory where you felt "Gratitude" in the past. 

Who was there? 

What happened? 

How did it all make you feel?

I want you to give the memory a lot of detail. And then notice what feeling comes up as a result.

It might be a warmth in your chest or throat. It could be a glowing feeling along your stomach. 

Whatever it might feel like. That is your Gratitude. 

I want you to explore gratitude in this way because it will feel easy. All you do is re-create the right context within your mind (through a memory) and it will flow from there.

2) Process any resistance to Gratitude
You might feel unfinished emotions mixed in with the things you feel grateful for.

For example, you're grateful for the relationship you have with your parents. But you still have some level of resentment or pain stored from your childhood.

Those feelings will make it difficult to work with gratitude. Why?

Because each time you bring up the feeling of gratitude, you will also bring up those other feelings.

But this is good news! Now you get the chance to process those feelings.

You can process them by experiencing the sensation and then expressing how it feels. 

For example, you feel a tightness in your gut during gratitude practice. You then say aloud what state what the sensation feels like. Paying attention to any images and mental thoughts that arise with the sensation.

It might feel intense. If it feels too intense, please be gentle with yourself and stop.

Stay with that emotion for at least 90 seconds. Experience it as honestly as you can for at least 90 seconds. 

Afterwards, go back to your gratitude practice.

3) Create a practice
I have mentioned "practice" a few times. You will find it very simple.

Let me share my practice with you:

Open my notebook every morning

Write "Gratitude" at the top of a new page

Look around my immediate space to see what inspires gratitude

Write down anything that inspires gratitude

Repeat steps 3/4 until my list feels long and healthy

The point of a practice is to do it often. You get outsized benefits by doing a little bit each day.

And of course, this is something to play around with. Make it your own. After all, it is your gratitude.

Gratitude can save your life.
It saved mine.

# Expertise is measured by the quality of your questions

When you start out, you ask basic questions.

What is this thing?
How does it work?
Why is it important?
How does it relate to other things?
Over time, your questions evolve. You accumulate more information that allows you to ask different questions. Expert questions.

But...

Experts don't know everything there is to know. To me, they are really good at asking questions that no one else knows how to ask.

Starting with basic questions and gradually making their way to more advanced questions over time.

They pose questions that accumulate information so that they can form a newer, higher quality question. 

We can replicate this for ourselves by: Writing important questions down. 

Your mind will forget your questions. Write them out. Update them often. Stay with a question and see how far it will take you. 

Run experiments. Reflect. Retry.

Any question refined long enough will take you to the edge of knowledge. Every time.

So what question will you follow?

# Overcoming internal blocks

When you feel blocked. Stop. Close your eyes. Take a breath. And ask yourself.

"What bad thing happens if I..."

Make a life change that you're feeling uncertain about
Ignore the urge to eat unhealthy food
Stop scrolling on your phone
Whatever else might be bringing up the block
Listen to what comes up.

Pay attention to any images/sensations/sounds that emerge from your subconscious -- ignore the voice in your head for now.

Your subconscious is trying to protect you from the bad thing that will happen if you do X.

Knowing this -- you can make a new choice because...

Seeing what was unconscious forces it to change.

You can do something new.

(Thanks to Chris Larkin for the inspiration: https://chrislakin.blog/p/the-absence-of-self-rejection)

# Your heart is a vehicle

Your heart does more than pump blood. It transports your spirt to where it wants to go.

You can get into your heart by feeling it. Once you get used to feeling your heart. You are free to use that feeling anyway you want.

When I meet someone new, I listen to them from my heart. My attention doesn't leave that area.

When I am deciding what to do next, I imagine each choice, a path I can walk along, and then I feel each path with my heart. I take the path that feels the best.

When I want to experience the divine. I feel through a prayer with my heart. 

Your mind will take you to the stars but your heart will take you home.

# How to create

Creating something new requires less thought than you might realize. In fact, I believe you create the best when you’re not thinking about what you’re doing.

This can feel counter-intuitive to most people, “aren’t you supposed to think?”. What they miss is that thinking can sometimes get in the way of creating. Imagine that your brain has “modes” and 2 modes that it uses a lot are “thinking” and “creating”, but your brain can only be in one mode at a time. 

That means when you’re thinking, you’re not creating and vice versa.

So, how do you spend more time in the creating mode? 

Spend less time thinking. 

And you do that by attaching less importance to thoughts. You will have a lot of thoughts. But none of them are really that important. Some might scare you into reacting. But if you see them for what they are, they stop influencing you.

Then, eventually, you’ll drop into flow. And that flow will connect you to what you want: the creative juice.

It’s this juice that turns into creating new things. You are just getting out of the way.

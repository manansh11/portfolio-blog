*"... healing requires something more **nuanced**: the capacity to feel another's experience so precisely that what's suffering can finally feel itself being felt."* 

- Daniel Thorson

## **You can experience this within yourself**.

Whenever you feel emotionally painful sensations in your body, allow the pain to *feel itself*.

Almost as if it comes alive. Sentient. Some type of being within your body.

And then, give this being the chance to relate positively to you or *(to an ideal parent, deity, etc.)* so that they can feel, *felt*.

If that feels hard to do, think about people in your life who made you feel *seen*. Remember how they could precisely intuit how you were feeling. As if they knew what has going on for you without needing to know the story behind it.

You can give yourself that same experience.

Here is a basic practice:

1. As sensations come up, **Allow** the sensation to know themselves 
2. **Take** the sensations POV, feel what it must be like for them to experience YOU! To feel *FELT*
3. **Accept** whatever they have to say to you

Awaken. Attune. Accept.

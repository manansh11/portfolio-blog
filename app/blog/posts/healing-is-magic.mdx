*"... healing requires something more **nuanced**: the capacity to feel another's experience so precisely that what's suffering can finally feel itself being felt."* - Daniel Thorson

## My addition: **you can experience this within yourself**.

If emotionally painful sensations arise in your body, allow the pain to feel itself.

As if it becomes self-aware. Sentient. Some type of being within your body.

Then, give this being the chance to relate positively to you or (to an ideal parent, deity, etc.) so that they can feel, *felt*.

If that feels foreign, think about people in your life who have really seen you in the past. Remember how they felt what was happening under your words. As if they knew what has going on without you telling them.

You can give yourself that same experience.

1. Allow the sensation to know themself (sensation gains self-awareness)
2. Attune to the sensation and sense their pain (you relate positively to sensation)
3. Accept whatever they surface to you (if sensation trusts you, listen to whatever it has to offer)

Allow. Attune. Accept.

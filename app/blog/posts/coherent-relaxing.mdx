This is the last nervous system regulation instruction you may ever need.

This process is predictable. Reliable. Repeatable.

You can experience a profound meditative state if you follow it for long enough.

Here's what to do:

1) Sit on the edge of your chair, feet firmly planted on the ground, spine straight 

2) Set a timer for 10 minutes and tell yourself that you will not move for the remainder of this session

3) Close your eyes

4) Inhale to the count of 6

5) Without pausing at the top of your inhalation, immediately start exhaling to a count of 6

6) Without pausing at the bottom of your exhalation, immediately start inhaling to a count of 6

7) Repeat this cycle

8) While inhaling and exhaling, relax the 6 bridges.

## What are the 6 bridges?*

1. Your head and face

2. Your neck and tongue

3. Your hands

4. Your diaphragm and intercostals

5. Your pelvic floor

6. Your feet

Imagine that your body is a cup that can hold a golden fluid. 

As you inhale, that fluid starts from your feet and rises all the way up your body until it reaches the top of your head at the top of your inhale. 

As you exhale, imagine that fluid falling back down from your head back down to your feet.

When the fluid reaches one of the bridges, like your head and face, consciously relax that area.

This leads to better nervous system balance, incresed HRV, less stress, and a very deep meditative state.

*I first learned about the 6 bridges through Stephen Elliot, he is the originator of this phrase.

When you start out, you ask basic questions.

What is this thing?
How does it work?
Why is it important?
How does it relate to other things?

Over time, your questions evolve. You accumulate more information that allows you to ask different questions. Expert questions.

But...

Experts don't know everything there is to know. To me, they are really good at asking questions that no one else knows how to ask.

Starting with basic questions and gradually making their way to more advanced questions over time.

They pose questions that accumulate information so that they can form a newer, higher quality question. 

We can replicate this for ourselves by: Writing important questions down. 

Your mind will forget your questions. Write them out. Update them often. Stay with a question and see how far it will take you. 

Run experiments. Reflect. Retry.

Any question refined long enough will take you to the edge of knowledge. Every time.

So what question will you follow?

The practice: relax as much tension in your body as you can.

By relaxing, you automatically enter the present moment. 

As you move your attention around your body, finding areas to release tension, you build more presence. 

Which allows your body, your fascia, to resonate, like a tuning fork, with the present moment.

All you have to do is relax and resonate.

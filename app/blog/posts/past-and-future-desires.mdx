This morning, while on a walk outside, I listened to a story that had a line that caught my ear:

*"While he meditated on Shiva, he felt as if every past and future desire was already fulfilled."*

Since hearing that this morning, I have been playing around with how one might feel in the moment if all their past and future desires were fulfilled. 

Like, what if you lived under the assumption that everything that could be fulfilled, was fulfilled, *eventually*. 

Maybe you wouldn't need to worry about your desires so much because you can't really know if they will be fulfilled or not. You only really know once it happens and even then, maybe what you desired wasn't really what you *really* desire.

I want you to experience the value of relating to the present moment this way.

You can have your desires back later. But, maybe, just for now. Enjoy their complete fulfillment right this moment.

Here's how you might practice this:

1. Imagine a timeline extending back into your past and forward into your future
2. Float above that timeline
3. Float backwards, into the past, to the beginning of time (*like, before the big bang*)
4. Look towards now and assume all your desires have been fulfilled between the beginning of time and the present moment
5. Hangout here for a bit (*really, just take some time to enjoy that*)
6. Float back to the present moment
7. Float forwards, into the future, to the end of time (*after the big bang*)
8. Look backwards towards now, again, assume all your desires have been fulfilled
9. Spend some time here as well
10. Float back to the present moment
11. Settle back down into your body
12. Enjoy the peace

You might notice your body, specifically the muscles in your face, throat, tongue, diaphragm, pelvic floor, hands and feet, relax. The voice in your head might also sound quieter than it was before. And you might feel a sense of enjoyment or peace.

If you do experience anything remotely close to this, take pleasure in it! Even just a little peace is enough. 

Like my teacher once told me: *"We live in a desert. So whenever you find just a little bit of water. Take advantage of it! It's HUGE!"* The same goes for the peace you feel. Even just a tear drop.

So I will leave you with this thought: *what would it be like to feel like this all the time?*

Who would you be?

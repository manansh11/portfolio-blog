You can practice presence anytime, instanteously, by *knowing your experience is happening, as it happens.*

Start with your body. Just for second, feel your body existing. Give yourself the experience of knowing how your body is feeling as you feel it.

If that feels hard, then just pick one sense perception (like sight) and know it as it happens. Recognize that seeing is happening.

This probably feels abstract but I think you can do it. You simply become aware that something is happening as it happens.

Another way of doing this is asking yourself: *How does this want to be known?*

The tightness in your chest. The light outside. The sound around you. All the senses. Your thoughts. Feelings.

All of it can be known. So by asking yourself this simple question, you drop into relating with that experience right in the moment.

No thinking required.

So give it a shot! And know your experience!

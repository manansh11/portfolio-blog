In short,

1. Create a mental image in your minds eye of what you want
2. Imagine that image sinking deep into your subconcious
3. Wait for feelings of resistence to emerge and feel them fully
4. Watch your body make it happen

The image communicates what you want to your subconcious. Letting it sink activates your alpha and theta brainwaves. Imagine that image sinking into the roots of your mind, going through soil, around rocks, and going deeper and deeper. You can stop whenever it feels right to stop. When it feels "planted".

As you sink deeper, your conditioned beliefs will surface. These will be strong feelings. And it's great that they're coming up. Your only task is to acknowledge and recieve the information the feelings want to give you. Ask the feeling: "What do you want me to know?". Ask yourself: "How do I feel towards this feeling?". Your manifestation will work better if you fully recieve the feelings information and feel calm/curious/compassion towards the part.

If you've accepted all the feelings. Now you just need to watch your body.

This is not a thinking exercise. You've set the coordinates. Now it's time to quite literally watch your body take you there, as best as it can, with the resources it has.

My advice is to start small, pick a basic outcome like filling your water bottle, and go through the process. You will get faster over time. And you will get clearer. And you will get what you want.

But it's hard work. It's scary work. But it's worth it. 

Manifesting is about crafting your intent, cleaning your reactions, and watching yourself make it happen.

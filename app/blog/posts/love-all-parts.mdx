Love all the parts. Even the painful ones. Especially the painful ones. 

The tired ones. The scared ones. The worried ones. The hurt ones. The angry ones. The shameful ones. The guilty ones. The sad ones. The disappointed ones. The ones that think they aren't good enough. The ones that don't want to get into trouble anymore.

The ones who just want a break.

Love all your parts.

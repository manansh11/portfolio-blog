I've written about the heart before: [Your Heart is a Vehicle](/blog/heart-vehicle)

But this post is about some practical uses I am discovering.

To activate the heart. Just place your attention in that area.

Once you do, you will enter a "relational" type of processing reality. This feels totally unlike how the mind processes things.

Because, through the heart, you feel how things are related, without the minds interpretation. The heart does not think about it. The heart just knows.

It knows how things and people are related via love.

*So the heart is a lot like sunglasses that allows you to view the world through a lens of love.*

## Here are some practical uses I am discovering:

1. Allow attention to flow through the heart (like, if there is a pen, allow your attention to use the heart to feel it, helps you focus with devotion)
2. Use the heart to scan the body (helps with attuning to and uncovering your needs in the moment)
3. Use the heart to bring coherence to your enviroment (while looking out into the world with your heart, allow it to guide you through actions that bring your space into greater coherence and structure)

The practice is simple, stay with your heart, use it like a tractor beam. Work with it. It is a tender, loving, powerful tool that you can use to spread love and to experience greater levels of love.

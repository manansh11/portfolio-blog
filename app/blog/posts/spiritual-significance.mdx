Modern productivity often feels empty and pointless. 

An example of this is school. There are processes in my body-mind system. Parts of me that worry— "if I don't worry about schoolwork and assignments, they're not going to get done".

If that doesn't happen, I'll get a bad grade. A bad grade means wasted money. It means my parents might yell at me, or worse, feel disappointed.

Shame. Avoiding shame drives so much of the emptiness. Part of me can't stand the shame.

But creating a sense of spiritual significance could help. That's the hypothesis at least.

Because it lets you see the shame and contextualize it— letting it move and process by itself.

It helps you understand why "mind" resists. Because a mind without context, is a mind that cannot make sense of why it exists.

It needs significance.

The knowledge in our brains works in this way. Knowledge needs connections. If there's a neuron that isn't connected to others, it gets pruned away.

To create significance, you need to increase its relationality. Take something that feels isolated, like schoolwork, and connect it to something greater:

- How does this new thing fit into the story of your life so far?
- What significance does this thing have in relation to your ancestors?
- What devotional rituals can you start doing to make this task less mundane?

It becomes more than a task; it becomes a part of the tapestry of life.

The key is to keep exploring how to make these connections stronger. Adding more and more layers of significance.

To keep finding ways to make life spiritually significant.

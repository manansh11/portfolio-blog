Creating something new requires less thought than you might realize. In fact, I believe you create the best when you're not thinking about what you're doing.

This can feel counter-intuitive to most people, "aren't you supposed to think?". What they miss is that thinking can sometimes get in the way of creating. Imagine that your brain has "modes" and 2 modes that it uses a lot are "thinking" and "creating", but your brain can only be in one mode at a time. 

That means when you're thinking, you're not creating and vice versa.

So, how do you spend more time in the creating mode? 

Spend less time thinking. 

And you do that by attaching less importance to thoughts. You will have a lot of thoughts. But none of them are really that important. Some might scare you into reacting. But if you see them for what they are, they stop influencing you.

Then, eventually, you'll drop into flow. And that flow will connect you to what you want: the creative juice.

It's this juice that turns into creating new things. You are just getting out of the way.

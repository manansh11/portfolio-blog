Your heart does more than pump blood. It transports your spirt to where it wants to go.

You can get into your heart by feeling it. Once you get used to feeling your heart. You are free to use that feeling anyway you want.

When I meet someone new, I listen to them from my heart. My attention doesn't leave that area.

When I am deciding what to do next, I imagine each choice, a path I can walk along, and then I feel each path with my heart. I take the path that feels the best.

When I want to experience the divine. I feel through a prayer with my heart. 

Your mind will take you to the stars but your heart will take you home.

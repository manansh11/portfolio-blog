Most of us move through life believing we're making conscious choices. 

We pursue careers to feel successful, maintain relationships to feel loved, create art to feel valuable. 

But what if this entire frameworkâ€”doing things *for* something is actually a massive energy leak that keeps us from accessing our natural intelligence?

## The Monitoring System That Drains Us

When you do something for a reason other than itself, you're running two programs simultaneously:

1. There's the action itself
2. And then there's the monitoring system constantly checking: "Is this working? Am I getting what I need? Am I closer to being loved, safe, worthy?"

This split attention creates what we might call an *energetic hemorrhage*. 

Resources that could flow into the fullness of your action are instead diverted to managing and monitoring the state of your reason. It's like trying to dance while constantly checking a scoreboard to see how well you're doing.

## Tracing the Roots

If you follow any compensatory action to its source: the compulsive networking, the perfectionist tendencies, the people-pleasing. 

You'll likely find the same thing: *a failure of love.*

Somewhere in your history, there's a part of you that didn't feel fundamentally welcome in existence, where your worth felt conditional on performance.

So you developed strategies. Complex, intricate strategies to secure the love that should have been unconditional. And these strategies became so embedded in your operating system that you forgot they were strategies at all.

They just became "how things should be."

## The Wisdom Already Present

But here's what changes this predicament: those very sensations and emotions you've been trying to fix or manage already contain their own intelligence. That tightness in your chest isn't just something to breathe through or integrate. It has its own knowing about what it needs.

This is the profound shift. Instead of bringing techniques to our experience, we can bring a quality of awareness that asks: "What does this sensation already know? What is it already trying to do?" 

When we stop imposing our agenda, even the agenda of healing, and instead attune to the intelligence already present, something remarkable happens.

The sensation might need space, or movement, or to be held. But you don't decide this. You *perceive* it. Your role shifts from director to witness, from fixer to facilitator of what's already trying to unfold.

## When Action Flows from Wholeness

Flow states offer us glimpses of what's possible. 

In flow, the monitoring system goes offline. There's no gap between you and what you're doing, no constant checking if you're getting what you need. The action springs from its own source, complete in itself.

This isn't just more enjoyable. It's more effective. When you're not leaking energy into monitoring and managing, all that life force flows into the present moment. You become like water finding its way. Not because it has a reason, but because that's what water does.

## The Practice of Return

So how do we shift from a life of reasons to a life of natural intelligence? Paradoxically, we can't try to do things for their own sake. That just becomes another reason, another thing to monitor. Instead, we create conditions where this natural state can emerge.

Practices like Vivation offer a doorway. By fully welcoming each sensation as a unique form of bliss, by recognizing that our resistance to feeling is what creates suffering, we begin to dissolve the structures that generate reasons in the first place. We're not trying to fix ourselves; we're discovering what happens when we stop interfering with our own wholeness.

## The Deepest Permission

At the deepest level, this is about recognizing that you don't need a reason to exist, to create, to love. The Bhagavad Gita points to this when it says you're not entitled to the fruits of your actions, only to the action itself. This isn't a harsh teaching. It's ultimate freedom.

When you act from this place, you're no longer a person trying to get somewhere. You're life itself, expressing through a human form. Your actions arise not from lack but from fullness, not from strategy but from love.

The tightness relaxes. The monitoring quiets. And in that spaciousness, you discover what you've been seeking was never outside you at all. It was always here, waiting beneath the reasons, in the simple fact of being alive.

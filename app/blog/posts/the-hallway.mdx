I image myself going down the stairs, into the subconscious. 10 steps in all.

I open the door at the bottom. The first door in the hallway, on the left contains the inner child. I walk in. 

The "greeter" appears. He sits on a bed, wearing a yellow sweater with Goofy on it, rocking a bowl haircut. I connect with him and he tells me how happy he feels that I have worked with so many parts within myself. He shows me, in the next few rooms, all my parts. 

I leave this room. I go to the next room. The expanse. 

This room, when you walk in, sucks you into expansion. I feel my access to the ventral vagal nervous system. When I join with it, the greenness of it makes me feel safe.

I remember what Deb Dana shares about Ventral Vagal landscapes. Each landscape appears uniquely to the individual and comes with a sliding scale of depth. For me, just entering into Ventral Vagal brings gentleness and tingles. While going all the way into Ventral weighs like thousands of pounds of wet, nutrient-dense soil, feeding your soul.

I leave this room.


The next room. The Wizard.

I peer through — looking around his laboratory — I notice him hunched over a chemistry setup and tinkering with different vials. I ask: "Get me up to speed?". He looks up and gives me a smirk. With a vial in one hand, he trots over: "I shall heal that nasty viral thing in us. (I have Covid atm) You see this green thing? Medicine. To take it, imagine feeling into unwell parts. Imagine a green awareness flowing through."

I take the medicine. Following his instructions. I noticeably feel a bit better.

I go to the next room. The spirit animal. 

I see a dark, desolate forest. I look up and see a huge Owl. His eyes sparkle, made up of glimmers of gold and silver. I feel his calm. I feel a knowing emanating from him. He knows. He knows me. He sees me. I sit next to him. We both stare out into the forest. I feel that he wants to share something with me. A message. In a deep voice, I hear him in my mind as he grumbles "Open your eyes and see clearly. You miss the big picture."

I leave this room.

I head back into the hallway. 

The next room contains Gifts from the Higher Self.

I walk in. Immediately I smell a calming, soothing aroma. I walk through an ancient Egyptian palace. I see silk robes flowing down from the massive pillars. I look ahead and see an alter. Next to the alter, a curved sword and a bowl. I know it wants an offering. I slit my hand and let blood flow into the bowl. The bowl glows and disappears. On the mantel, I see a small, brown notebook. Inside the book I read about all the adventures awaiting in this life. I feel that whatever has given me this wants me to know that my life grows richer everyday.

I put the book in my pocket and head out.

I walk back down the hallway.

I go outside and ascend the stairs, back into this moment.

Clarity. Healing. Hope.

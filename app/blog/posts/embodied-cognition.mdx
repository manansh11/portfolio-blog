I don't like thinking as much as I once did.

Growing up, I loved to think about the world and the people within it. To think about my place in it.

But, as I've grown up, I think what I wanted was to have a felt-sense of existing in the world.

Looking back, thinking was a means to try to get that want fulfilled. But it didn't work. And all that left me with was a mind that likes thinking more than existing.

Some people won't see that as a problem. I don't. Not really. But I want to fulfill on that original desire.

To have the felt-sense of existing.

I have a few ideas on how:

1. Feel your body
2. Engage with thoughts through your body (Experience your thoughts/thinking in your body)
3. Repeat number 1

It won't work if you try to feel your body. Trying implies that the felt-sense is not immediately available to you.

Instead, notice how your body feels in the moment and go into that.

Notice what happens to the quality of your thoughts and thinking. You might be surprised just how clear your body can be.

        Experimental Coaching
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4 italic">
        No upfront fees. Bounty-based—you pay whatever the shift is worth to you.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-medium">What We'll Do</h2>
      <div className="mb-6 space-y-4">
        <p>
          You and I will enter a space to experiment and create real change. 
          You'll bring what's important—something you'd love to unblock or transform. 
          I'll bring deep listening, impartiality, and tools to help us explore and experiment together.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's no rigid curriculum. We'll gently investigate what's stuck, try experiments, and continue until something shifts meaningfully in your life.
        </p>
        <p>
        Together, we can explore transformations like:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Undoing emotional patterns to reduce suffering and live more freely</li>
          <li>Leveling up your career and wealth</li>
          <li>Crafting deeper, interconnected relationships with others, yourself, and reality</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-medium">How It Works</h2>
      <div className="mb-6 space-y-4">
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Apply:</strong> Send me a brief email describing one specific thing you'd like to change and why it's important now.</li>
          <li><strong>Selection:</strong> If you're selected, we'll have an initial conversation to understand your goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Sessions:</strong> We'll meet regularly to experiment and explore possibilities together, testing practical exercises between sessions.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-medium">Who This Is For</h2>
      <div className="mb-6 space-y-4">
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>You're comfortable with honest, open exploration.</li>
          <li>You're curious about AI tools but prefer guided human interaction.</li>
          <li>You're serious enough about change to reward it meaningfully when it happens.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-medium">But Wait, Isn't This Just Coaching?</h2>
      <div className="mb-6">
        <p>
          Well, no—I'm not a coach in the traditional sense. Think of this as a highly-attuned container where we run experiments together. It's a relationship first, not advice-giving or curriculum-based.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-medium">Why Don't You Charge Upfront or Per Hour?</h2>
      <div className="mb-6 space-y-4">
        <p>
          I use a bounty-based model because it aligns our incentives. You only pay if real, lasting change happens. This approach reduces your risk and allows us both to explore and experiment freely without financial worry. It also lets me gather insights and conduct real-world R&D to discover what's truly effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method is inspired by Chris Lakin, who has shown that bounty-based transformations are both ethical and remarkably effective.
